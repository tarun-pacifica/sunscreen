  question: How does Receva work?
  answer: When you purchase a Receva enabled smart home mailbox, you will receive a text message notification every time something is delivered into the box. Via the app on your smart phone, you can review your deliveries, open your parcel box and delegate access to friends. Couriers working directly with Receva will be able to seamlessly deliver parcels into your parcel box.
